    <p>Welcome to Dom Play! On this page, we have a script with two characters: Tony and Rico. Simply click on a character's line, and their lines will be highlighted. How does it work? Each character has a data-actor tag that connects to an anonymous function, capturing the actor's identity upon click. With the highlightActor() function, we display the currently clicked actor. We also establish a function to highlight the character clicked. By determining the active actor and using an if statement, we highlight the selected character's lines and revert to the default state when another character is clicked. Enjoy the simplicity of it all!</p>
